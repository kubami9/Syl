**Checkout:**
 - [ ] commits are squashed (if the number of commits is greater than 1)
 - [ ] PR includes all needed information including things listed in the PR template comment
 - [ ] code is clean: no repetitions, names that make sense, proper spacing, comments if needed etc. another human being can know what's going on
